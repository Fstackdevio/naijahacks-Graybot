# Education
# The lack of resource materials to anyone anywhere to undergo any educational research findings is quite low, which doesnt allow for proper findings and knowledge acquisition
# Our solution is to create an educational archive or repository which allows for the connecting of different levels of academia knowledge to interact and share their knowledge with the rest of the community as well as helping students with a vast resource of academic books
# flutter, android studio, firebase, twilo, etc
